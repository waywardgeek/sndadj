This program implements a new algorithm for changing the speed of speech.  The
quality of resulting speech, at least for high speed as in 2X and above, is
second only to sonic, and then only by a small margin.  The advantage of this
algorithm is simplicity.  Instead of a different algorithm for slowing down
speech, and speeding up for up to 2X, and yet another algorithm for over 2X,
this new algorithm does it all in one simple loop.

The algorithm breaks speech up into adjacent pitch periods of equal size, and
ovelap-and-adds them to create a single period of sound that can play back on
itself smoothly.  It then moves forward in the speech stream by the period and
repeats, creating another loop-able speech sample at the new position.  Playing
speech at any speed is simple a matter of shifting from playing one loop to the
next at the desired speed, overlap-adding to transition between them smoothly.
Speeds from 0 to 10X are easily covered by this algorithm.

The amazing thing is that this algorithm works so well, with so little code, and
that it's so flexible.  The fact is sound can be thought of as little looping
tapes, and just switching from one to the next actually works!
